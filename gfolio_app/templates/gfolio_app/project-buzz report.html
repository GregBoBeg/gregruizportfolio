    The Buzz-Report is a proprietary financial trading tool that analyzes up to 100 stock tickers
    and identifies which stocks will see a daily increase in relative volume and price action.
</p>
<p>
    The tool is written in Python and runs on any PC with an internet connection.
    It uses scraping methods to aggregate data from multiple financial websites and social media platforms.
    The data is analyzed and processed using a number of complex proprietary calculations.
    Finally, each stock is ranked on multiple data points, using a curve function of diminishing returns.
</p>
<p>
    The end result is a spreadsheet listing each stock, their key decision data points,
    and their strength indicators for trading and investing purposes.
