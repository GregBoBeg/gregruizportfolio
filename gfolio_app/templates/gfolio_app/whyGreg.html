            <span>Hi.  My name is Greg.  </span>As you can tell, I have a passion for writing great software.
            I work with clients who require experience, maturity, quality and attention to detail.
            These are qualities I’ve valued my entire life, leading me from software development,
            to project management, to a Director position at a Fortune 500, and a couple VP positions.

        HTML, CSS, Python, Django, JavaScript, Node.JS, GIT, GitHub, AWS and Heroku.
