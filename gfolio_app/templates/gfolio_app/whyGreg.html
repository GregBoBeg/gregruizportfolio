            <span>Hi.  My name is Greg.  </span>As you can tell, I have a passion for writing great software.  
            I work with clients who require experience, maturity, quality and attention to detail.  
            These are qualities I’ve valued my entire life, leading me from software development, 
            to managing large-scale projects, to a Director position for a Fortune 500, and a couple VP positions.  
        </p>

    <p>
        Throughout my career, my experience has stretched far and wide in all areas of business and technology.
        However, I do have 8 years of prior web development experience. 
        Today, I enjoy the simplicity and beauty of programming, combined with the convenience of working from home.
    </p>
    <p>
        My expertise includes:<br>
        HTML, CSS, Python, Django, JavaScript, Node.JS, GIT, GitHub, AWS and Heroku.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether you’re looking for someone to take on your next web development project 
        or you’re looking for my proven work ethic for something larger, 
        contact me so we can determine whether my services are a good fit for your next project.
    </p>
    <p>
        Best Regards,
    </p>
